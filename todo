To-do list for the firewall manager

Validation:
  Check for non-reverse rules (each incoming should have a corresponding outgoing), and automatically commit reverse rule
  Rule overlap - Print out warning for redundant rules
  Critical error for removing 443 access in fwman.yaml
  Automatically commit changing 'location: w.x.y.z/0' to 'location: 0.0.0.0/0'
  Automatically commit an expiration date to a rule with 'ports: -1--1'
  Spell-check/suggestion for security groups that don't exist but are similar to ones listed in groups.yaml

New Integration:
  Openstack
  Juniper/Cisco
  Perforce
  VMware ESX

Advanced:
  Templating/clusters
  In-memory network simulation (Discover edge instances & apply policies to those, e.g. no internet/ssh)
  Reachability - Create port-connection graph of EC2 instances, showing which nodes can connect to which other nodes on each layer
  Implement PCI Requirements
